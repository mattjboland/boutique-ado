<!--Let's begin with the script to increment the quantity.
On the click event of the increment quantity button.
First we'll want to prevent the default button action.
And then find the closest input box.
The closest method here searches up to the Dom. And the find method searches down.
So what we're saying here is from the button element go up the tree to the
closest input group class.
And then drill down to find the first element with the class quantity input.
Now we'll just cache the value that's currently in it in a variable called currentValue.
And use that variable to set the input boxes new value to the current value plus one.
It's then simple to copy this function and just change the new value to minus
one for the decrement quantity button.
Let's test it out. First we need to include it in the product detail template.
So I'll add the post loadjs block here at the bottom.
Include the parent block with black.super
And then include products/includes/quantity_input_script.html
Now let's open the site and view any products details.
It seems the buttons are working just fine but there's a small issue in that
we can use them to increment or decrement the value of the input past
its intended minimum and maximum.
Let's add a script to disable the buttons accordingly.
Back in the input script include, I'll write a function for this called handle enable/disable
Which as the name implies will handle enabling
and disabling the buttons based on the value of the input they're controlling.
Because each input will be associated with a specific product id.
We can pass that item id into the function.
And use it to get the current value of the input based on its id attribute.
I'll call that currentValue and notice the use of the backticks here
which you might recognize as a template literal similar to string formatting in Python.
Which allows us to stick this variable right into the string nice and easily.
If you don't know where this id syntax is coming from
check the id attribute on the input box in the product detail page
This is why we included the item id in the id attribute.
Now that we've got the current value we'll want to disable the
minus button if the current value is less than two.
And disable the plus button if the current value is greater than 98.
This allows a range of 1 to 99 which is the same as the min and Max on the input element itself.
Finally to disable the buttons. I'll use the prop method
which sets the disabled attribute on each button to true or false
depending on whether the current value is less than 2 or greater than 98.
We'll want to call this function each time either button is clicked.
So to do that I'll go to the increment click event.
Get the item id using the data method which pulls it from the data item id
attribute we added on the button.
And then pass it into the handle enable/disable function.
Then I'll copy it into the decrement script as well.
Save the file and test it again.
Now it's almost working but as you can see there's one other bug.
Since the default of the input box is 1
It allows us to click the minus button and potentially add a quantity of 0 to the bag.
The input elements min and Max will prevent this via form validation.
But let's add a couple more pieces of functionality just to solidify this.
First we can disable the minus button by default. By getting all the quantity inputs on the page.
Iterating through them. And for each one calling the enable/disable function
as soon as the page loads.
Also right now the handle enable/disable function won't be called
if the user uses the built-in up and down arrows in the number box to change the quantity.
But we can make that happen by listening to the change event on the quantity input
and calling it every time the input changes.
With that finished we can test one more time.
See that no matter how we change the input box.
whether using the keyboard the plus and minus buttons
or the built-in up and down arrows. We cannot go outside the intended range.
If someone manually types in a number outside the range.
The form validation will prevent them from submitting the form.-->
