<!-- finally we'll create the profile template.
I'll copy the checkout template this time and make a couple minor adjustments.
First removing bag tools.
Then changing the extra CSS file to one for the profiles app.
And finally removing everything else except for the header which I'll change to my profile
Lastly I'll create an empty CSS file in the appropriate directory.
And that's where we'll maintain the CSS for this app. -->

                <h2 class="logo-font mb-4">My Profile</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row"><!--We need to render the form in the profile template so let's head there and create a new row.
                            Half of this page will be the profile and the other half will be the order history so I'll create two columns.
                            And then the first one I'll add a small paragraph heading and then a form.
                            As you might guess it will submit to the profile URL. And use the post method which we'll write in a bit.
                            I'll give it an id of profile-update-form so we can easily identify it.
                            And inside I'll render it as a crispy form.
                            Lastly we need a submit' button and that will look just like our other buttons
                            and float on the right of the column.
                            We might as well make the heading for the other column also while we're at it.
                            And for now, just spit out all the users orders if there are any. So we can make sure that's working.-->
